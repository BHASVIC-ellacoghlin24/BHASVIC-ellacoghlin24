## About me
#### My name is Ella Coghlin and I am a student at BHASVIC.
#### I am most interested in working as a games developer and I hope to eventually create and release my own game.
#### Currently, I am beginning to work on my A level coursework project, which will be a roguelike dungeon crawler game.
#### I have lots of patience. I often work on personal art projects which can take a mimimum of 6 months to complete. Additionally I have good teamwork skills and enjoy working as a team, as it motivates me to complete the work to the best of my ability.
